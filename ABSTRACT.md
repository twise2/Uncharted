Uncharted

Board game where you put out planets on a table at random. 
Players get a player card determining their "faction" (space)
Planets have resources and abilities associated with them.
Players can move at "Warp Speed" that takes warming up engines on ships.
Players can put down "Gravitational fields" that can stop warp travel.
Board gets created as the game goes on by these fields getting placed.
Each player has seperate wincons (exporations/conqueror/etc....)
Maybe a large hex board to not have to deal with measuring spaces.


Space combat
Exploration
Surveying Planets
Conquering Planets
Harvesting from planets
Gravitational Blocking
Warp drives
Punching through gravitational fields
Exploration of unknown regions with risk.
Core space and ability to keep exploring infinitely out (further out space has black hole risk) (deck of hex cards) (could have mechanic of if you run out of cards, universe begins to dematerialize at furthest point from current hex.
Resources (Each faction has different uses for different resources)
  Adamantine (strong metal, usually used for weapons/ships etc...)
  Anti-matter (resource usually used to warp/perform ship operations)
  Amalgamate (special space crystals used in navigation/for magic operations)
  Black Matter (resource used in gravitational operations, stopping ships, etc....)

Actions every faction can take
  FREE
    harvest a planet (free, need ship on hex)
    move (free, move as many ships to an adjacent hex as you want)
    attack (roll dice based on number of ships | modifiers have a cost)
  COSTED ACTIONS
    build a cruiser (adamantine/anti-matter)
    warp ships (anti-matter | move accross large location)
    construct a warp field (black matter | puts border on a hex, stops warps in or through the border, but can still warp out)
    chart (amagamate | pull up the next hex before moving into it)
